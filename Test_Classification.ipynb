It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Defining a Python function for obtaining credentials from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining parameters of the Model object\n* Using the Model object to generate response using the defined model id, parameters and the prompt input\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data Gathering\nThis cell defines to gather the train and test dataset"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# get tarin dataset\n\nimport os, types\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botocore.client import Config\nimport ibm_boto3\n\ndef __iter__(self): return 0\n\n# @hidden_cell\n# The following code accesses a file in your IBM Cloud Object Storage.
