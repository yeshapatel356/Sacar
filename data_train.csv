Customer_Service,Satisfaction
Customer service was friendly and helpful.,1
Customer service was good at MSP airport and the process was very fast.  From getting off of the plane to leaving with my rental car was less than 45 minutes.,1
I do not  understand why I have to pay additional fee if vehicle is returned without a full tank.,0
"Based on the customer service personnel I encountered most recently, I would say it is vastly preferable for the personnel to be able to at least pretend to care whether the customer ever actually receives a car rental that was reserved months in advance.",0
Provide more convenient car pickup from the airport parking.,0
"all went quite without hassle, they picked me up to get the car it was great.",1
VERY slow service!,0
Its nice when you get in your car and it has already been started up with the A/C or heating going.,1
They could really try work harder.,0
"I would like the personnel to pretend they care about customer, at least.",0
"Customer Service is great since you don't have to deal with any people, per se.  The car is ready and waiting for you and the shuttle just drops you off to it.",1
Customer service went out of their way to provide a car that would fit our needs,1
they were trying to satisfy me even though my wife tells me I was being rude,1
We got our car very quickly.,1
long lines moved quickly,1
"I did everything on-line - never talked to an agent during booking.  There were no problems, even though I had to switch car sizes after initial reservation. Agent on duty for pick-up was courteous.",1
"The customer service agent was helpful, but I find that providing all of the information to the agent takes too long.  It would be nice if I could provide all of the information to the agent prior to coming the rental place.",0
"We had a small problem with the size of car we reserved being available. The company was able to send another car over from a different location. We were delayed in getting on the road, but were satisfied with the car.",1
"I had to wait in line for a long time to get and return the vehicle.  Also, the car was not clean.",0
It was absolutely ATROCIOUS! My wife and I were in a foreign country  when we realized that our car had an expired license plate and expired proof of insurance!,0
"Very nice, free upgrade",1
they should not try so hard to up sell,0
They were friendly and helpful enough.,1
long lines waiting for the rental pick.,0
"We needed a minivan on very short notice to drive out of town to a funeral.  Enterprise staff worked hard to find us one, and they did. We smashed the car into a parking garage pole.  Since we had purchased the comprehensive insurance we didn't have to go through all of the B.S.",1
I guess it really DOES "try harder.",1
Experience was fine,1
what customer service? It was a nightmare,0
People were nice.  Service was fast.,1
"Well since I used to work for a car rental company and at the time I rented I was still working with the company, I was treated with nothing but respect and received a free upgrade as well.",1
"""sorely lacking""  helpdesk was not much helpfull",0
"delayed shuttle, almost missed flight, bad customer service",0
The rental car guy was cute.,1
I would like the reps be knowledgeable about the immediate area around the rental agency and or have maps for the area available free of charge.,0
customer service was OK,1
"I was happy that we arrived very late and there was still a live person to help us get our rental.  We had no problems with the car, and returned it easily.",1
They were very good and took care of what I needed. Very quick.,1
Everyone was very friendly. They even drove us to the airport since we were running late for our flight.,1
Did not have some problems. My car was not ready on time.,0
"We dealt with customer service at car pick-up place, and drive off in few minutes.",1
they were extremely helpful and did whatever they could to help us.,1
customer service was OK,1
"Initially the representative handled the situation badly.  No car was available, even next day.  Then the rep helped to find us a car in another agency.",0
"My last experience was  seamless.  The only thing I didn't like was having to fill the tank with gas before turning it in.  It was inconvenient, but I didn't want to pay the hefty fill-up charge to the rental company.",1
Everything was great.  The line was a little long to get the car but it was a good experience.,1
adequate to the price. It was fine,1
"It would be nice if they included maps to the airport drop off with the car, last time we got lost returning the car and almost missed the flight.  There was nothing on the exit that indicated rental returns.  Actually the one I really liked, was when we",0
it was fine.,1
The customer service people were very nice.  During my vacation I locked my keys in the car.  The rental company sent someone out with a new set of keys to unlock the car.,1
"States have different rules and regulations pertaining to speed, radar detectors, even when light should be on.  Customer services reps should have a handout or be knowledgeable of a particular state's laws.",0
price too high and location off premise too far,0
"They were great as far as I could tell, they explained what needed to be done to use the University pricing.",1
No problems,1
The company was overwhelmed by the number of customers verse the number of available agents and they were not articulating their situation to the customers well enough. I think we waited for almost 3 hours just to get a rental car. It was ridiculous.,0
None I  rarely rent cars,1
The rental car person was impertinent.,1
"Our customer service representative was polite and well-dressed. He smiled appropriately and answered my questions, not from a rehearsed script, but from his own frame of reference. He shirt was neatly pressed and his hair was professionally coifed.",1
Even economy class cars are too expensive.,0
"Employees had nice, new uniforms.",1
"customer service was great until we returned the car.  I experienced an issue with damage to the car, and felt that things were left unanswered and still waiting for a response from them.",0
"Very good. willing to drop me off and pick me up from location, upgraded me to higher level due to availability",1
The customer service was very friendly and knowledgeable.  She suggested to upgrade to the SUV and it worked out much better for our trip.,1
they were very nice and willing to help in any way they could,1
It was not as bad as it usually is.,1
"I have had a few recent rentals that have taken a very very long time, with no offer of apology.  In the most recent case, the agent subsequently offered me a car type on an upgrade coupon and then told me it was no longer available because it had just be",0
price TOO HIGH and off premise location is NOT convenient.,0
Guys were extremely nice.,1
"It was good, got the car we wanted without much of a wait in picking up and dropping off",1
The car rental company that I went with had very good customer service. They were out of a certain car I reserved and gave me a upgrade and apologized.,1
Having knowledgeable personnel is very important,0
"The service I have is always good, I have used the same company for many years and I know the counter personnel personally.  It is always good to know that they are willing to help you in any situation. ",1
"For leisure/vacation, I have never personally rented the car.  I have always left that up to my significant other and she did not complain to use this company",1
"friendly, but could not making any decisions on own",0
If there was not a desired vehicle available the reps explored all options including competitors to assist in finding an available vehicle. This level of service brought me back not to their competitor but the company as this reflects on their overall quality.,1
Customer service was fine,1
"it seems that they never have the class of car that I ordered.  also, the last time I got there earlier than I thought and they wouldn't let me have the car until the time that I had requested it because their computer wouldn't allow it.",0
They were too pushy in trying to sell insurance.,0
"Anywhere you go you will find good customer service and bad customer service.  Since I have rented so many cars, there have been too many experiences to recall so I can't say anything definitely bad",1
"My experience up to date was  good.  It was inconvenient to return car clean, but I had to pay the hefty charge for rental.",1
They had the class of car that I ordered.,1
Customer Service at Alamo was RUDE. We waited in line for over an hour to get our car. Car was bad. Had to change it few days later. Another family traveling with us was upgraded to a larger car as they were out of the type of car booked.,0
They were idiots.  The car had problems and they were unable to fix them or provide a replacement without a lot of hassle.,0
No suggestions.  Customer Service was good.,1
I had to pay more because of some hidden fees. It disappointed me.,0
service was good.,1
they could not provide driving directions,0
I thought that they were very short and not very friendly. I felt like they hated their job and could care less about the customer.,0
The car should have been brought to us instead of us trying to find it in the lot.,0
Service was fast. Car was parked close-by.,1
They did not have the car I wanted.  upgraded me to a car I did not like and did not want.,0
"Had problems with windshield wipers that affected usability.  Problem was not solved.  Customer service was NOT helpful. Because of franchising, I was not able to get help from an office other than the one I rented from.  I had driven 60 miles from that location and there was another location 2 miles from where I was staying.",0
Although there were no available car in category stuff assisted in finding an available vehicle.,1
Everyone was very helpful.  The car was ready for me on time and I didn't have to wait a long time at the counter.,1
no complaints,1
All the people I dealt with were pleasant and helpful.,1
"You need more staff to accommodate travelers who are in a hurry. Specifically, cut down the wait time to either retrieve or turn in a rental car.",0
"The only unpleasant aspects of interacting with personnel from the company was having to wait in a long line since most windows were closed. Also, they tried really hard to sell additional insurance coverage which was obnoxious.",0
they were a little slow,0
 The service was polite and professional. I was attended to quickly and courteously.,1
Please back to lower the prices.,0
